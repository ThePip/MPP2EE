ModPlug Player
Forked in case the original creator has abandoned it, there is an extreme bug where the drag and drop function deletes the file on windows 10 on every version of the windows download I tried, do NOT use that function... I am hoping I can revive this project and make it more functional... but my c++ is very beginner at the moment and I dont even know how to stop this project from being public.

WARNING!!!
!~DO NOT USE THE DRAG AND DROP FUNCTION WITH ANYTHING BUT A COPY OF A FILE~!
